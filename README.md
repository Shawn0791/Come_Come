## Game Overview

This is a game based on a "viral video adaptation", which was one of the tasks in my learning process. I made this game based on "here comes the airplane". I adapted the core mechanic from "a command triggers food to fly into your mouth" to "a keystroke triggers a puppy to come back to you".

Independent Development

## Design Concept

This is a game based on the concept of "viral video idea extraction." I extracted the idea of "command triggering food flying into the mouth" from the "here comes the airplane" video and turned it into a game mechanic where you trigger a dog to return to your side by pressing a key.

## Game Mechanics

The player has an indestructible dog by their side, and the player can summon the dog back to their side by pressing a key. Objects touched by the dog will be destroyed.

## Game Highlights

The game is easy to pick up and play with simple controls, and the satisfying destruction and addictive, mesmerizing sound effects make it compelling.

## Game Controls

Movement: keyboard WSAD/joystick

Calling puppies: keyboard F/joystick B

Game Goal: Explore the forest
